# MOSS-Plagiarism-Checker
Developed for MSRIT's Information Science Department, under the guidance of Dr. Mydhili K Nair. Developed for the course IS6EB1 (Machine Learning)

About the Project
======
The MOSS-Plagiarism-Checker uses the <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">Stanford MOSS Plagiarism Checker</a> service to perform the following functions: -

1. Download code from specified git repositories of students for a particular assignment
2. Collate the necessary files from all of the students, and send to MOSS for code plagiarism check
3. The report generated by MOSS is used to **generate detailed reports**
4. Finally, the reports are depicted in the form of a **graph to show students who have similar submissions**

Installation / Setup
======
1. Clone the repo to a folder of your choice

2. Install the required python libararies using
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
